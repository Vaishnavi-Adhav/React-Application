                    Week 1: Distributed Systems and Alternative Consensus
                    Blockchain architecture is built on the foundation of decades of computer science and distributed
                    systems literature.

                    Week 2: Cryptoeconomics and Proof-of-Stake
                    We examine the meaning and properties of cryptoeconomics as
                    it relates to its two compositional fields: cryptography and economics.

                    Week 3: Enterprise Blockchain: Real-World Applications
                    We look at various existing enterprise-level blockchain

                    Week 4: Scaling Blockchain: Cryptocurrencies for the Masses
                    One major obstacle to widespread blockchain adoption is the problem of scalability.
                    We define scaling first as it relates to
                    Bitcoin as a payment method, and compare it to more traditional forms of payment such as credit
                    cards.
