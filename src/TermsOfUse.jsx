                    you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms of Use, all
                    applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible
                    for compliance with any applicable local laws. If you do not agree with any
                    of these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing this site. The materials
                    contained in this School are protected by applicable copyright and trademark law.

                <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
                <p className="terms">
                    The materials on the School’s website are provided 'as is'. The School makes no warranties,
                    expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties, including without
                    limitation,
                    implied warranties or conditions of merchantability,
                    fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of
                    rights.
                </p>
                <h3>Limitations</h3>
                <p className="terms">
                    In no event shall the School be liable for any damages (including, without
                    limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption)
                    arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on the School’s website, even if
                    the School or an authorized of the School has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility
                    of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties,
                    or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply
                    to you.
                </p>

                    The materials appearing on the School’s website may include technical, typographical,
                    or photographic errors. The School does not warrant that any of the materials on its web site
                    are accurate, complete, or current. The School may make changes to the materials contained on its
                    web site at any time
                    without notice. The School does not, however, make any commitment to update the materials.
